# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-10)

**Core value:** A player can sit down, pick a Standard-legal deck, and play a full game of Magic against a competent AI opponent -- with all cards behaving correctly according to MTG comprehensive rules.

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [v1.2 init]: Custom MTGJSON types (~50 lines) instead of mtgjson crate (missing defense field, unnecessary transitive deps)
- [v1.2 init]: Author ability definitions from oracle text/rules, use Forge output only for validation (GPL contamination avoidance)
- [Phase 21 context]: REVERSED prior decision — Vec<AbilityDefinition> refactor included in Phase 21 (not deferred). Emitting Forge-compatible strings perpetuates licensing risk. Typed enums for all four definition types (Effect, TriggerMode, StaticMode, ReplacementEvent)
- [Phase 21 context]: AtomicCards.json committed to repo, one ability JSON per card in data/abilities/, schemars for schema generation

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- GPL contamination legal analysis has LOW confidence -- consider clean-room authoring approach for complex multi-ability cards
