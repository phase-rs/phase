// BlockAssignmentLines, AttackTargetLines) routed through here so they
// cannot drift apart — the bug this helper exists to prevent is exactly
// that drift.
//
// This lives in its own leaf module (rather than `gameStateView`) so
// non-rendering callers like `GameProvider` can count the installed
// snapshot's seats without importing the viewmodel's render graph.
